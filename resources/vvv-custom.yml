# vm_config controls how Vagrant provisions the virtual machine, and can be used to
# increase the memory given to VVV and the number of CPU cores. For WP core development

# It can also be used to override the default provider being used within Vagrant.
# Due to a limitation within Vagrant, the specified provider is only respected on a clean `vagrant up`
# as Vagrant currently restricts you to one provider per machine
