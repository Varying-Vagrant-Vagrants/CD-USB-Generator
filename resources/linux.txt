Virtualbox and Vagrant on Linux
===============================

Due to the varying flavours of Linux distros available, it's not practical for the
Virtualbox and Vagrant installers for Linux to be included on this USB drive.

Instead, you can download them from the following URLs:

 * Virtualbox:
	https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads
 * Vagrant:
	https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html

While you're waiting for these to download, continue with step 2 in instructions.txt.
